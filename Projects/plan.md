Letâ€™s start the YouTube channel by the time when I finish developing my first side project.

- I will earn 500 million dollars in 5 years from 2025 to 2030 by launching 4 services a year working 16 hours a day.
- I will move to the United States.
- I will create a company called "Void" with the goal of optimizing the space and the logo will be perfect square.
- I will invest all the money into the company.
- I will change the world by
  - developing robots for
    - military defence
    - polices
    - construction sites

When it comes to creating a company, I think it is very important to have the working prototype working first and develop from there. Before doing what I really want to do, I should have the framework that proves what I am thinking is working and makes money consistently.
