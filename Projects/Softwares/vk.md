# VK Shell: a productivity tool for terminal developers

## Basic Idea

VK Shell is a CLI productivity tool for developers. Being tired of switching between applications? Put everything together into the terminal! We got Code Editor, Todo List, Presentation, API Search, Langaugae/Framework/Library documentations, and literally everything you would need as a developer.

## Technologies

VK Shell will be developed with Go and Cobra, which is the CLI tool.
